    Hi, I'm Kelvin! I'm currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon
    working on threat orchestration and response solutions. I graduated from the
    University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Applied Science in
    Electrical Engineering. I am currently based in Toronto, Canada.

    Keenly interested in cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and
    robotics. My past experiences include working on 5G router validation at

    I'm most excited by how technology can play a part in building a better
    tomorrow. There's so much to explore out there, it'd be a shame if one were
    bored. Beyond work, you can find me crimping at the bouldering gym, wielding
    my Sony A7II camera, or figure skating at the nearest rink.
