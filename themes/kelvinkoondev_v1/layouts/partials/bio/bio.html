    I am a Firmware Engineering Intern currently working at Tesla. Previously, I
    had the opportunity to work with incredible engineers at Amazon, Huawei, and
    Netgear as an intern. I graduated from the University of British Columbia,
    specializing in Electrical Engineering.
    <br />
    My interests are broad, but I'm especially intrigued by distributed systems,
    security, and robotics. During my studies, I worked on autonomous soccer
    playing robots with UBC Thunderbots. I was also deeply involved with
    <a href="https://ubcecess.com/">UBC ECESS</a> and
    <a href="http://www.ubcieee.org/">UBC IEEE</a> through spearheading
    mentorship, managing treasury, and supporting event photography.
    <br />
    I'm most excited about bettering myself and others around me wherever I go.
    I'm always interested in learning new things and having fun with it. In my
    downtime, you can find me bouldering, figure skating, or reading.
