    Hi, I'm Kelvin! I'm currently an engineer at Amazon working on
    countermeasures for threat orchestration and response. I graduated from the
    University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Applied Science in
    Electrical Engineering. I'm also rebuilding
    <a href="https://github.com/BabiriGG/babiri_v2" target="_blank">babiri.gg</a
    >, a competitive Pokémon data visualization platform.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am keenly interested in distributed systems and cloud infrastructure,
    particularly in robotics and security applications. My past experiences
    include working on 5G router validation at

    During my studies, I worked on autonomous soccer playing robots with

    and

    through mentorship, treasury, outreach, and event photography. You can read

    Prior to undergrad, I was a competitive figure skater as part of BC/YT's
    Provincial Team. I also previously represented Canada at the 2016 Pokémon
    World Championships. In my free time, I enjoy bouldering and photography.
    I'm most excited about bettering myself and others around me wherever I go.
