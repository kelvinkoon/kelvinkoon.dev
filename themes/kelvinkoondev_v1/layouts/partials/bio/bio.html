    Hi, I'm Kelvin! I'm currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon
    working on threat orchestration and response solutions. I graduated from the
    University of British Columbia with a B.A.Sc in Electrical Engineering.
    Currently, I'm based in Toronto, Canada.

    Keenly interested in cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and
    robotics. My past experiences include working on 5G router validation at

    Unabashedly excited to about tackling novel problems, increasing STEM
    accessibility, and building a better tomorrow. There's so much to explore, I
    don't know if I'll ever stop - or want to stop - wondering who I want to be.
    Beyond work, you can find me bouldering at the gym, exploring with my Sony
    A7II camera, or figure skating at the nearest rink.
