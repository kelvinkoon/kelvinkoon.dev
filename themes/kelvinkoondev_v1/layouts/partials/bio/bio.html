    I am a Firmware Engineering Intern currently working at Tesla. Previously, I
    had the opportunity to work with incredible engineers at Amazon, Huawei, and
    Netgear as an intern. I graduated from the University of British Columbia,
    specializing in Electrical Engineering.

    My interests are broad. I'm especially interested in distributed systems,
    security, and robotics. During my studies, I worked on autonomous soccer
    playing robots with UBC Thunderbots. I was also deeply involved with
    <a href="https://ubcecess.com/" target="_blank">UBC ECESS</a> and
    <a href="http://www.ubcieee.org/" target="_blank">UBC IEEE</a> with
    mentorship, treasury, and event photography.

    I'm most excited about bettering myself and others around me wherever I go.
    I'm always interested in learning new things and having fun with it. In my
    downtime, you can find me bouldering, figure skating, or reading.
