<h2 id=prologue>Prologue</h2>
<p>UBC&rsquo;s Electrical and Computer Engineering department offers no shortage of advanced electives for upper year students. The vast selection includes computer architecture, power systems analysis, and even quantum computing. As someone who has too many interests, I&rsquo;ve worried about fitting all my interests into 12 credits. Though I ended up taking more credits than needed, the opportunity to dive into these specialized areas was invaluable to exploring my interests.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be reviewing the advanced electives I took to provide insight to which electives may (or may not) be suitable for you. I&rsquo;ll also briefly touch upon electives I wish I&rsquo;d taken and what I&rsquo;ve heard from other students who&rsquo;ve taken them. To further preface, my electives were primarily involved with Computer Engineering disciplines despite being in the ELEC program.</p>
<h2 id=wishlist-electives>Wishlist Electives</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;d think I would&rsquo;ve taken all the courses I wanted after spending 6 years at UBC. Unfortunately, due to scheduling or workload issues, I decided to pursue other electives. I&rsquo;ll briefly list thoughts I&rsquo;ve heard in passing and why one might want to take them.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-411/>CPEN411 (Computer Architecture)</a>: Hardware is becoming increasingly prominent in applications such as ML and Graphics. If you enjoyed CPEN211 or worked at Intel, you&rsquo;ll likely find the material interesting. Definitely a heavy workload with high expectations, which is on par with digital hardware courses here.</li>
<li><a href=https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-432/>CPEN432 (Real-Time System Design)</a>: A notable course for ELEC students, since embedded-related courses aren&rsquo;t plentiful. Students work through their projects using <a href=https://www.freertos.org/>FreeRTOS</a>, which is an industry-relevant tool. Without <a href=https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-331/>CPEN331 (Operating Systems)</a> or <a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MATH&course=220">MATH220 (Mathematical Proof)</a> credits, I felt underprepared (eg. using proofs for scheduling theory). Previous course offerings featured a heavy courseload, but curriculum and instructor changes have addressed this.</li>
<li><a href=https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/elec-421/>ELEC421 (Digital Signal and Image Processing)</a>: Despite struggling in <a href=https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/elec-221/>ELEC221</a>, I was intrigued by the image processing applications with DSP techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=advanced-electives-review>Advanced Electives Review</h2>
<p>And without further ado, here are the electives I took.</p>
<h3 id=elec331-computer-communications>ELEC331 (Computer Communications)</h3>
<p><a href=https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/elec-331/>ELEC331</a> teaches you how the Internet works.</p>
<h3 id=cpen442-introduction-to-computer-security>CPEN442 (Introduction to Computer Security)</h3>
<p><a href=https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-442/>CPEN442</a> covers a lot of ground in the cybersecurity domain.</p>
<h3 id=cpen431-design-of-distributed-software-applications>CPEN431 (Design of Distributed Software Applications)</h3>
<p><a href=https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-431/>CPEN431</a> features a deep dive into how computer teamwork makes the computer dream work.</p>
<h3 id=elec400m-machine-learning-fundamentals>ELEC400M (Machine Learning Fundamentals)</h3>
<p><a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=ELEC&course=400M">ELEC400M</a> is the credit-exclusive equivalent to <a href=https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc340/>CPSC340 (Machine Learning and Data Mining)</a>.</p>

<p>Electives let you explore what you like and (more importantly) don&rsquo;t like.</p>
