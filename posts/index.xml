The project&amp;rsquo;s development halted shortly after as I acclimated to full-time work. The service proceeded to implode a few months after, left in radio silence until recently. With the advent of 2023, I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired the bandwidth to focus on developing a new suite of robust data tools. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from industry to productionalize projects intersecting with my interests.</description></item><item><title>Building Babiri.net</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/building-babiri-net/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/building-babiri-net/</guid><description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note As of 2023, babiri.net has been rebranded to Statsugiri.

Prologue After 2 months and 132 commits, babiri V2&amp;rsquo;s API has been launched! babiri is comprised of an API for aggregated usage stats gathered from Pokémon Showdown replays. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited to share how babiri came to be, why it exists, and the technology powering the project. This post is also inspired by Kevin&amp;rsquo;s zeal.</description></item><item><title>UBC ECE Electives Review</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/ubc-ece-electives/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/ubc-ece-electives/</guid><description>Prologue UBC&amp;rsquo;s Electrical and Computer Engineering department offers no shortage of advanced electives for upper year students. As someone who has a tendency to like too many things, I&amp;rsquo;ve worried about fitting all my interests into 12 credits. Though I ended up taking more credits than needed, the opportunity to dive into new fields was invaluable to my learning.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be going over the advanced electives I took to hopefully help you decide which electives may (or may not) be suitable for you.</description></item><item><title>LeetCode Intro Guide</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/leetcode-intro-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/leetcode-intro-guide/</guid><description>Prologue The guide you are reading assumes you have taken CPSC259 if you are in ELEC or CPSC221 if you are in CPEN / CPSC, which are the introductory Data Structures and Algorithms (DS/A) courses offered at UBC. Although CPSC259 is less in-depth compared to CPSC221, the deficiencies can be remedied through practice. Even if you have not taken either course, the article can still provide take-aways to the current state of interviews.</description></item></channel></rss>
