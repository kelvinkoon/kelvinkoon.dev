## Prologue

UBC's Electrical and Computer Engineering department offers no shortage of advanced electives for upper year students. The vast selection includes computer architecture, power systems analysis, and even quantum computing. As someone who has too many interests, I've worried about fitting all my interests into 12 credits. Though I ended up taking more credits than needed, the opportunity to dive into these specialized areas was invaluable to exploring my interests.

I'll be reviewing the advanced electives I took to provide insight to which electives may (or may not) be suitable for you. I'll also briefly touch upon electives I wish I'd taken and what I've heard from other students who've taken them. To further preface, my electives were primarily involved with Computer Engineering disciplines despite being in the ELEC program.

## Wishlist Electives

You'd think I would've taken all the courses I wanted after spending 6 years at UBC. Unfortunately, workload and scheduling issues meant I decided to pursue other electives.

The electives listed are ones I would have taken given more semesters. I've also included details I've heard from previous students.

-   [CPEN411 (Computer Architecture)](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-411/): The prominence of hardware for graphics and ML drew my interest in the course. Seemingly heavy workload with high expectations, which is on par with digital hardware courses here (eg. CPEN211).
-   [CPEN432 (Real-Time System Design)](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-432/): Embedded courses aren't plentiful for ELEC and the opportunity to work with [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) is neat. Without [CPEN331 (Operating Systems)](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-331/) or [MATH220 (Mathematical Proof)](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MATH&course=220) credits, I felt underprepared (especially with using proofs for scheduling theory). Previous course offerings featured a heavy courseload, but curriculum and instructor changes have tried to address this.
-   [ELEC421 (Digital Signal and Image Processing)](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/elec-421/): Despite struggling in [ELEC221](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/elec-221/), I've heard good things about the course from my peers. Digital image processing applications (eg. biomedical imaging) also piqued my interest.

## Advanced Electives Review

My advanced electives were heavily influenced by my internship experience. As such, your mileage may vary depending on how interested you are in the topics presented.

### ELEC331 (Computer Communications)

> Analysis, design and implementation of computer networks and their protocols. Application layer protocols, transmission control protocol (TCP), Internet protocol (IP), routing algorithms, reliable data transfer, multiple access, Ethernet.

[ELEC331](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/elec-331/) is an introduction on how the Internet works. Starting from the application layer, the course walks through each layer until reaching the bits in the physical layer.

It's a bit of an Eureka moment when you understand how the Internet's infrastructure works from the moment you click a link. Concepts like how reliable TCP is built on an unreliable IP layer was insightful into understanding how the Internet works under the hood. Networking is everywhere (as seen in my other electives), and I think the course content does a sufficient job at instilling the fundamental concepts.

The course is taken directly from the [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/eighth.php) textbook. As such, there's quite a bit of memorization, unfortunately. The slidesets help alleviate this issue, but it can still be overwhelming (particularly at the two lowest layers). Furthermore, the assignments are a mixed bag. The Python programming assignments are a gentle introduction to socket programming. However, the Wireshark labs are repetitive and tedious.

All in all, it's a popular elective for both ELEC and CPEN students. A fair courseload for a 4-credit course.

### CPEN442 (Introduction to Computer Security)

> Security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities from technical perspectives; cryptography; software and web security; access control, assurance, accountability; usable privacy and security; engineering of secure systems; cryptocurrencies.

[CPEN442](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-442/) is an ambitious course, being the only computer security course offered at UBC.

### CPEN431 (Design of Distributed Software Applications)

> Communications, processes, naming, synchronization, consistency and replication, fault tolerance, object-based middleware, and security technologies for distributed applications.

[CPEN431](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-431/) features a deep dive into how computer teamwork makes the computer dream work.

### ELEC400M (Machine Learning Fundamentals)

> Linear models, support vector machines, gradient descent methods, multilayer perceptron, backpropagation algorithm, deep neural networks, clustering and density estimation, expectation-maximization algorithm, theory of generalization, VC dimensions, bias-variance trade-off, validation methods, regularization

[ELEC400M](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=ELEC&course=400M) is the credit-exclusive equivalent to [CPSC340 (Machine Learning and Data Mining)](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc340/).

## Parting Words

Electives let you explore what you like and (more importantly) don't like.
